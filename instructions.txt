Welcome to the exercise for Enverus Data Science. These are some sample data
manipulation tasks you would encounter as a developer on our team.


For a test dataset, please use these Google playstore reviews here on Github.
Using Python, please organize a project that accomplishes the following:


    1. Filter the dataset to have only 
        a.one entry per App name and 
        b.remove apps with invalid ratings
    2. Add a new gross revenue feature for each app
    3. Return the top 3 grossing apps in each category


Please feel free to use libraries such as Pandas. You may reach out with any questions,
but you may also make assumptions about edge cases and explain your reasoning to
the team.

If completed ahead of time, please submit your results before the intervew. Thanks!
